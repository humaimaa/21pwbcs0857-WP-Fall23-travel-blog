Even though I have many short stories about traveling the world, I want to share the one from Hawaii. 
I’ll never forget the time I landed on the remote Hawaiian island of Molokai and was told, “We have a wedding and two funerals on the island, and so we have run out of cars.” 
It was at about the same time as a popular movie with a similar title was out, so the statement had a humorous overtone.
However, since this was hang-loose Hawaii, I was assured by a mellow employee that all would work out and so there was really nothing I could do but relax into it. 
The car agency arranged for (and paid for) a cab to deliver us to our condo so we could check-in,
 and told us that the next morning someone would pick us up and deliver us to the mule ride.
Done, though we did almost miss our morning ride due to confusion regarding the meeting spot, 
but the point is we didn’t miss it, and we were told by that driver that our car would be waiting in the parking lot for us after our ride.

And there it was! Pure Molokai magic.

            <h2>Visiting A Real Quechua Village</h2>
            <img src="story2-image.jpeg" alt="Story Image 2">
            <p>
Before our round the world trip we always thought that in Peru visiting Machu Picchu would be our most amazing experience.
Although Machu Picchu is simply indescribable, it turned out that a totally improvised adventure left a much stronger mark on us.
When we were staying at a Couchsurfer’s place in Cusco, we asked him whether it would be possible to visit a real Quechua village.
He said we could try, although we would have to find it out ourselves since these Quechua communities live quite far in the Andes and 
there’s no public transport to get there.In the end, we got very lucky, since looking for transport in Ollantaytambo.
we found out that the local doctor and other social workers were going to visit some of these tribes and they let us join them.
We were really happy because we had the chance to stay in a Quechua community, learn about their traditions, see the colorful clothes they wear every day 
and take part in their daily routine for some time. We often had to use hand gestures to communicate, since most of these people don’t speak Spanish, only Quechua. 
This is one of our most interesting travel stories and a real heart-warming experience that we will never forget.
