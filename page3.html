            <h2>Snake Attack In Vietnam</h2>

            <p>
                One of the best short travel stories that I have is from Vietnam.
                We had been on our bikes since 8 am as we made the 80-mile journey between Hue and Hoi An and about 3 hours had gone by.
                It was David and me on one bike and our friend Jon on a bike in front of us showing us the way.
                We were just about to take a final stretch of country road and head onto highway 1 for the next leg
                when we saw something in the road ahead of us.
                It was up ahead of Jon and it was the kind of thing you couldn’t really tell what it was until you were right on top of it.
                In an instant, we saw Jon whip his legs up as a huge snake lunged at his leg when his scooter sailed next to it. 
                I was mortified as I am very afraid of snakes.
                The last thing I wanted was to have this thing striking at me as we cruised by.
                We pulled over, laughed, and discussed the size of it while noticing a local man running down the road with a long stick. 
                He was hollering at us excitedly and pointing at the road.
                Apparently, snakes of that size are worth well over 1.2 million dong 
                and the man was bursting with excitement about catching the venomous beast.
                Asking where it went, he moved into the grass at the edge of the rice field in pursuit.
                The movement caused the snake to flee into the rice paddies
                the local man immediately gave chase into what became a dance between him and the snake. 
                Each challenged the other until the man lept to the opportunity and seized the snake by the head with his bare hands.
                He smiled proudly as he came back to the road, showed off the snake then as swiftly as he appeared, 
                left us standing there while he made his way down the road back to his house. Snake in hand. 
                You don’t see that every day! It was definitely one of these fun travel stories that we will never forget.

            <h2>Stepping Out Of A Comfort Zone In Dubai</h2>
            <img src="story6-image.jpg" alt="Story Image 6">
            <p>
                In 2014, I was scrolling through a Facebook group 
                when I spotted a post claiming $200 roundtrip tickets to Duba (btw if you want to save on your next trip
                check out this trip com coupon). As is routine in that group, I confirmed the deal, checked my calendar, and booked tickets 
                no asking friends, no waiting for job approvals, and no overthinking. It would be my first trip alone.
                I met Jibri during the layover. She got my attention and started chatting about travel deals and groups. 
                During our small talk, I considered putting my earphones back in or making up a reason to excuse myself.
                Instead, I decided to embrace a new person and see where it could lead.
                Not only did we exchange contact information to meet-up in Dubai, 
                but we joined other travel group members who rented out a yacht for an afternoon cruise along the Persian Gulf.
                It was totally outside of my comfort zone and totally what my comfort zone needed – to be stretched out of shape! 
                I met amazing people and forged exciting friendships.
                Dubai was life-changing. I learned to trust my abilities and instincts even when I had to improvise.
                I learned that strangers are just friends who haven’t met you. Most importantly, 
                I learned that my suitcase was much lighter when I didn’t fill it with fear.
                This year, I took a solo trip to Thailand and it was the absolute best. 
                More solo trips are in my future as I continue to challenge myself to get uncomfortable and do more than I thought I could.
