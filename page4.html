                My favorite travel story is from a business trip I took to a small town in Kentucky.
                One morning, my co-worker noticed that there was a helicopter parked out on the hotel’s lawn
                which we thought was odd but pretty cool.That week, we ended up befriending the helicopter’s pilot and his wife
                and talking to them at breakfast and the evening periods of light snacks.
                He somehow offered to take us up for a free ride, so one morning before work, 
                we each took a turn hopping in his helicopter and flying up and over town. 
                He banked, dipped, and shot up to the sky like a rocket during our jaunt through the Kentucky skies.
                I still find it funny that I wouldn’t get in a car with a stranger, but I had no qualms about hopping in a helicopter with one. 
                I’ve been traveling on an almost weekly basis for work for six years.
                That’s still one of the coolest things that I’ve gotten to do on the road.
